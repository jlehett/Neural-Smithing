## 4.3 Size Versus Depth

Although a single hidden layer is optimal foor some functions, there are others for which a single-hidden-layer solution is
very inefficient compared to solutions with more layers. Certain functions can be implemented exactly by small networks with
two hidden layers but require an infinite number of nodes to approximate with a single hidden layer network.
